-- Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to find the length of the shortest path
-- in a weighted, directed graph
--
-- The naive formulation below performs an exponential number of
-- recursive calls (O(3ⁿ) for a graph of n nodes).  Once the
-- UDF is compiled into a CTE and call sharing is applied, we observe
-- the expected O(n³) complexity of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
-- Additionally, over time, memoization leads to the materialization of
-- the graph's node distance matrix, which drastically cuts down
-- evaluation time.

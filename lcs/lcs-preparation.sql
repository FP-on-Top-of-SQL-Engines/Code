-- Longest common subsequence
--
-- Consider sequences (ABCD) and (ACBAD).
-- They have 5 length-2 common subsequences: (AB), (AC), (AD), (BD), and (CD);
-- 2 length-3 common subsequences: (ABD) and (ACD); and no longer common subsequences.
-- So (ABD) and (ACD) are their longest common subsequences.
